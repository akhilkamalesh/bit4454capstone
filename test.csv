DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Originally issued July 8. 2004. Last Revised October 25. 2010 Release #04-174 CPSC Consumer Hotline: (800) 638-2772 CPSC Media Contact: (301) 504-7908 CPSC Announces Recall of Metal Toy Jewelry Sold in Vending Machines Firms agree to stop importation until hazard is eliminated Note: Firm's telephone number removed. web site deleted. WASHINGTON. D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). four toy jewelry importers today announced the voluntary recall of 150 million pieces of toy jewelry sold in vending machines across America. CPSC has determined that some of this toy jewelry contains dangerous levels of lead. posing a risk of lead poisoning to children. Only about half of the 150 million pieces of toy jewelry actually contains lead. but. because it is difficult to distinguish the lead jewelry from the non-lead jewelry. the industry decided to recall all of it. The four firms are A & A Global Industries. Inc.. of Cockeysville. Md.; Brand Imports. LLC. of Scottsdale. Ariz.; Cardinal Distributing Co. Inc.. of Baltimore. Md.; and L. M. Becker & Co.. Inc.. of Kimberly. Wis. CPSC has received one report of lead poisoning when a child swallowed a piece of toy jewelry containing lead that was previously recalled. No reports of injury or illness have been received for the recalled products announced today. Young children sometimes mouth or swallow items like these. and lead can leach from the jewelry into the child's body. Lead poisoning in children is associated with behavioral problems. learning disabilities. hearing problems and growth retardation. The four firms have advised the Commission that they have stopped importing toy jewelry with lead and are committed to working with the CPSC staff on eliminating hazardous levels of lead in future importations of toy jewelry. "With millions of pieces of jewelry involved in this recall. I urge parents to search their children's toys for this jewelry." said CPSC Chairman Hal Stratton. "Throw away this recalled toy jewelry." CPSC has issued guidance urging firms to eliminate lead in consumer products. or. if lead is used. to assure it is not accessible. CPSC collected and analyzed some samples of toy metal jewelry sold in vending machines and found that 10 of those products had lead that could be accessible to children. The industry volunteered. out of an abundance of caution. to recall additional products. This toy jewelry recall involves various styles of rings. necklaces and bracelets. The rings are gold- or silver-colored with different designs and paint finishes with various shaped center stones. The necklaces have black cord or rope or gold- or silver-colored chains. The necklaces have pendants. crosses or various geometrical designs or shapes. and can include gemstones. The various styles of bracelets include charm bracelets. bracelets with medallion links. and bracelets with faux stones. All the jewelry was manufactured in India. The toy jewelry was sold in vending machines located in malls. discount. department and grocery stores nationwide from January 2002 through June 2004 for between $0.25 and $0.75. The industry estimates that this toy jewelry is kept in homes for a short period of time. but parents should look for these items in their homes. Consumers should throw away recalled jewelry. Consumers can contact these importers for more information about this recall by calling (602) 636-3908 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday., Metal Toy Jewelry Sold in Vending Machines, Costume/Children's Jewelry, A&A Global Industries, Lead, n/a, CPSC Announces Recall of Metal Toy Jewelry Sold in Vending Machines, False

DC 20207 April 15. 2003 Alert #03-535 CPSC. BJ's Wholesale Club. Inc. Announce Recall of Red Devil Gas Grills PRODUCT: Gas Grills - BJ's Wholesale Club. Inc.. of Natick. Mass.. is recalling about 2.800 Red Devil gas grills sold at BJ's Wholesale Club stores. These red metal gas grills have a tripod stand. They have a logo on the label of the lid and grill base showing a devil cooking at a grill with the writing. "Red Devil." The lid also reads "The Portable Outdoor Kitchen." Components sold with the grill include a heat plate. an oversized skillet with handles. a table-safe serving trivet. and carrying totes. BJ's Wholesale Club Stores sold these grills from about May 2000 through June 2002 for $70. PROBLEM: The product's design allows consumers to light the grill at an air intake tube. instead of at the burner. Though the grill appears to function normally. gas inside the air intake tube ignites. The tube can reach temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and present a burn hazard to consumers. In grills manufactured before August 1998. the heat produced by lighting the grill at the air intake tube damaged the plastic support piece. and caused the grill to fall to the ground. When it collapses. flames from the grill can burn nearby consumers and ignite surrounding combustibles. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: More than 1.000 consumers returned their grills to the manufacturers because the grills collapsed. Other retailers have reported 44 incidents of consumers suffering burns to legs. hands and fingers. including reports of some third degree burns. after the grills collapsed during use. There have been no incidents reported by BJ's Wholesale Club customers. WHAT TO DO: CPSC urges consumers to stop using these grills immediately. Consumers who purchased Red Devil gas grills from BJ's Wholesale Club Stores can return them to the local BJ's Wholesale Club for a refund. For more information. call BJ's Wholesale Customer Service at (800) BJS- CLUB (257-2582) anytime. or visit the firm's web site at www.bjs.com. The Home Shopping Network (HSN). QVC. Value City. Schottenstein and Wal- Mart previously notified their customers about the hazard these grills pose. and provided a remedy. Consumers who purchased their Red Devil Gas Grills from another retailer. should contact the retailer. If that retailer does not provide a refund. repair or replacement for the grill. consumers should contact CPSC at (800) 638-2772 anytime. About 155.000 of these grills were manufactured by e4L Inc.. of Encino. Calif.. and Quantum North America Inc.. of Encino. Calif. Because these manufacturers are out of business. CPSC issued a warning about these grills in May 2002. Additional Red Devil gas grills were manufactured by Cadac. of Roodepoort. South Africa. and also are included in the recall. CPSC sued e4L Inc. and Quantum North America Inc. to obtain a recall. and an administrative law judge granted CPSC a default judgment when these manufacturers failed to appear. The firms are liquidating their assets under bankruptcy law. Since Quantum and e4L have declared bankruptcy. there is no remedy available for grills bought from retailers other than BJ's Wholesale Club. HSN. QVC. Wal-Mart. Value City and Schottenstein stores. About 19.300 of these grills. sold directly by e4L. were recalled in July 1998 because the burners could disconnect from the burner pan. The firm received 21 reports of the burners on these grills disconnecting and one consumer suffered burns. Even if consumers participated in this previous recall program. they should stop using these grills since this warning addresses a different hazard., Red Devil Portable Outdoor Kitchen gas grills, Grills.

Quantum North America Inc.. of Encino. Calif. The product's design allows consumers to light the grill at an air intake tube. instead of at the burner. Though the grill appears to function normally. gas inside the air intake tube ignites. The tube can reach temperatures of up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit and present a burn hazard to consumers. In some earlier grills. the heat produced by lighting the grill at the air intake tube damaged the plastic support piece. and caused the grill to fall to the ground. When it collapses. flames from the grill can burn nearby consumers and ignite surrounding combustibles. There have been 44 reports of consumers suffering burns to legs. hands and fingers. including reports of some third degree burns. after the grills collapsed during use. More than 1.000 consumers returned their grills to the manufacturers because the grills collapsed. These red metal gas grills have a tripod stand.

Grills purchased from retailers other than the HSN and QVC are dangerous. and CPSC urges consumers to stop using them immediately. Since Quantum and e4l have declared bankruptcy. there is no remedy available. Consumers who own one of these grills. who are aware of any incidents with these grills. or who want additional information should contact CPSC at (800) 638-2772 anytime. Vendors who are still selling these grills also are encouraged to stop doing so and contact CPSC.

Pa.. are announcing a voluntary replacement program. The company will provide free parts and labor to replace 35 million Central fire sprinklers with O-ring seals. The program also includes a limited number of O-ring models sold by Gem Sprinkler Company and Star Sprinkler. Inc. totaling about 167.000 sprinkler heads. Central discovered the performance of these sprinklers can degrade over time. These sprinkler heads can corrode or minerals. salts and other contaminants in water can affect the rubber O-ring seals. These factors could cause the sprinkler heads not to activate in a fire. Central is providing newer fire sprinklers to provide enhanced protection to its sprinkler customers. This is the third largest replacement program in CPSC history. Central will provide free replacement sprinkler heads and the labor needed to replace the sprinklers. Central will arrange for the installation by using its own Central Field Service crews or sprinkler contractors. This program includes two kinds of sprinklers. "wet" and "dry." "Wet" sprinklers are installed in piping that is filled with water. "Dry" sprinklers are used in areas that may be exposed to very cold temperatures and the exposed piping does not contain water. Central has received 4 reports of "wet" sprinklers failing to activate during a fire and 9 similar reports on "dry" sprinklers. These incidents resulted in two property damage claims against Central. The sprinklers were installed nationwide in a wide variety of buildings. including houses. apartments. hospitals. day care facilities. schools. dormitories. nursing homes. supermarkets. parking garages. warehouses. and office buildings. Central manufactured 33 million "wet" sprinklers with O-rings from 1989 until 2000 that are covered by this program. Central also manufactured 2 million "dry" sprinklers with O-rings from the mid-1970's to June 2001 that are covered by this program. The program also covers 167.000 sprinklers with O-rings manufactured by Gem Sprinkler Co. and Star Sprinkler Inc. from 1995 to 2001. A listing of all the models covered under this voluntary replacement program is attached to the end of this release. The fire sprinkler heads have the words "CENTRAL" or "STAR". the letters "CSC". the letter "G" in triangle. or a star-shaped symbol stamped on either the metal sprinkler frame or on the deflector. The model designation and date may also be stamped on the frame or deflector. The deflector is the flower. or gear-shaped metal piece at one end of the sprinkler head. Laboratory testing has indicated that most of the heads would operate in a fire situation. but certain tested heads required higher water pressure to activate than may be available in particular buildings. Due to the number of sprinklers involved. this program will be phased in. with priority based on the age of the sprinklers. the population affected (e.g.. buildings such as nursing homes and hospitals will be given priority). and whether the sprinklers show signs of corrosion or leakage. This program puts in place an orderly process that serves the public interest. For more information call the Notice Packet Request Line at 1-800-871-3492 24 hours a day. 7 days a week or the program's web site at www.SprinklerReplacement.com. Sprinkler systems must be regularly inspected. and maintained like a building's heating. cooling. electrical and elevator systems. In addition. industry standards state that dry sprinkler heads should be tested. and replaced if necessary. at least every 10 years. Central believes all fire sprinkler heads should be tested no later than 10 years after installation. and depending on water quality and other factors. more frequent testing may be appropriate. Central is also contacting foreign governments for these O-ring sprinklers in their countries., n/a, n/a, Central Sprinkler, n/a, n/a, CPSC.

D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Central Sprinkler announced today the nationwide recall of approximately 8.4 million Omega brand fire sprinklers manufactured since 1982 by Central Sprinkler Corp. and its subsidiary. Central Sprinkler Co.. of Lansdale. Pa. CPSC alleges that Omegas are defective and could likely fail in a fire. This recall announcement follows the resolution of the lawsuit filed by the Commission staff against these companies on March 3. 1998. CPSC alleges that. on average. between 30 and 40 percent of Omegas removed from various locations across the country for testing failed to activate as they should. In some buildings. all Omegas tested failed to activate. CPSC is warning consumers that they are at risk of bodily injury or death and should have Omegas replaced as soon as possible. CPSC is urging consumers to take immediate action to determine whether the buildings where they live and work are equipped with Omegas. and if so. to call the Omega Sprinkler Recall Hotline to participate in the recall. Properly functioning fire sprinklers save lives when a fire occurs. With the Omega sprinklers. this line of defense may not be there when it is needed most. CPSC has received reports of Omega sprinklers not functioning in 17 fires. At least four persons suffered injuries. including burns and smoke inhalation. Over $4.3 million in property damage has been reported. The fires occurred between 1990 and the present in Arizona. California. Florida. Georgia. Indiana. Maryland. Massachusetts. Michigan. New York. Pennsylvania and Texas. In some cases. the sprinkler directly above the fire failed to operate. Omega fire sprinklers are installed in homes. schools. hospitals. dormitories. nursing homes. prisons. offices. hotels and other buildings as well as federal buildings. including the Smithsonian Museums and the U.S. Capitol. which house many of the country's historical artifacts. Omegas have been or are being removed from many state and federal buildings. including the White House. As part of the settlement agreement. Central has asked Underwriters Laboratories to withdraw its listing of approval for all Omega brand fire sprinklers. Consumers themselves should be able to determine whether their homes or other buildings are equipped with Omega fire sprinklers. On most models. consumers will be able to see three flat round metal disks stacked one above the other with a small space between each disk. Consumers should not attempt to unscrew the sprinkler or shut down their sprinkler system to determine if they have Omegas. Central will send consumers a packet of information to help them identify the sprinklers involved. The recall of the Omega sprinklers includes models referred to or marked as follows: C1 (or C-1) C1A (or C-1A) C-1A PRO (or C1-A PRO) C1-A PRO QR EC-20 EC-20A R-1 R-1A R-1M Flow Control (FC.

DC -- Over a million Brinkmann and COOK'N CA'JUN charcoal water smokers distributed before 1993 have a hole in the charcoal pan that can. if used over a flammable surface like a wooden deck. cause a fire. Use over flammable surfaces is contrary to current warnings and instructions included with the smokers. In addition. some of the metal brackets holding the water pan and/or grills on these models have sharp edges that can cause cuts.Today. Brinkmann. in cooperation with CPSC. announced a program to give the owners of these charcoal water smokers a kit to close the hole and reduce the fire risk. The kit also contains redesigned brackets to replace the original ones. Although Brinkmann is fully confident in the safety and quality of its charcoal water smokers. Brinkmann is voluntarily participating in this program to help prevent injuries.According to Brinkmann. charcoal water smokers typically have a charcoal pan with a hole in it. a water pan in the middle of the unit. and grills for food on the water pan and at the top. CPSC is investigating other brands of charcoal water smokers that may present a similar risk of fire. CPSC views all charcoal water smokers that use exposed charcoal pans with holes that may allow coals to fall out of the smoker as a potential fire risk. and is seeking corrective action from other companies. CPSC will announce these actions at the earliest possible time.Since 1974. Brinkmann has recorded approximately 10 claims of fires allegedly involving holes in the charcoal pan of Brinkmann smokers and 6 claims of cuts allegedly involving the brackets of these charcoal water smokers.To identify your charcoal water smoker. look for the names "Brinkmann" or "COOK'N CA'JUN" on the top or body of the smoker. If either of these names appear. check the charcoal pan at the bottom. If the pan has a hole. it is involved in this program. Only Brinkmann and COOK'N CA'JUN water smokers manufactured before 1993 are included in this program. These water smokers were sold by major retailers nationwide. Charcoal water smokers manufactured after 1993. as well as Brinkmann Gourmet and COOK'N CA'JUN S-80. and Brinkmann and COOK'N CA'JUN electric or gas water smokers are NOT included in this program.

CPSC learned of this problem when Casablanca notified the Commission of its intention to initiate a recall. The affected fans have a ball and canopy mounting system and were manufactured and sold nationwide from January 1981 through September 1993. The retail prices for the fans vary by model and time period sold. The prices generally range from $200 to $2.500. A ceiling fan owner can identify the recalled fan by looking at the metal nameplate located on the exterior of every Casablanca fan. A fan subject to the recall will say "Casablanca" on the nameplate. In addition. the ball and canopy mount is visible from the bottom of the fan. Also. the second letter of the serial number on the nameplate will be A. B. C. O. P. R. S. T. U. V. W. X. or Y. This recall does not cover Pasadena brand fans.

5422 , 93052 , 1993-03-17T00:00:00 , https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1993/Stacking-Chairs-May-Collapse-Causing-Serious-Injury , MARCH 17. 1993 Release # 93-052 WASHINGTON. DC -- CPSC today is unilaterally warning consumers that certain inexpensive. upholstered. metal framed stacking chairs. manufactured and distributed by Flanders Industries. Inc. of Fort Smith. Arkansas from 1970 until 1985. may collapse during use. Flanders reportedly manufactured and distributed approximately one million of this commonly used type stacking chair prior to 1985. No other Flanders' products are involved in this warning. Flanders has informed CPSC that it has had reports of 26 incidents in which it is alleged that such a chair manufactured by Flanders collapsed. The Commission staff believes that the incidents occurred when the chairs broke in the area where the legs are joined to the frame. The failures reportedly cause the chair to collapse as the seat and leg sections separate. Several of the alleged injuries resulting from such collapse reportedly involve fractured bones and serious injuries to the back. These stacking chairs are inexpensive upholstered vinyl material with metal frames. They may be used by the public in various settings including hotels. offices and restaurants. In most cases. the chairs involved in known incidents of failure were in use for approximately five to 10 years prior to failure and may not have been regularly inspected for metal fatigue or damage which may occur as a result of normal wear and tear or abnormal abuse. Since the users of these chairs are constantly changing. a user will have no advance warning that a chair is defective and about to collapse. Since other manufacturers' stacking chairs may be of similar design and construction. CPSC urges owners of all stacking chairs to inspect the chairs thoroughly on a routine basis. Flanders has informed CPSC that it has evidence of other manufacturers' similar chairs collapsing after extended use and abuse. Moreover. since identification of the manufacturer of a particular chair may be difficult after the chair has been in use over a significant period of time. owners are urged to inspect all chairs similar to those which are the subject of this warning. The estimated one million chairs manufactured and distributed by Flanders constitutes a small percentage of the number of stacking chairs manufactured and distributed by the industry over the years. These chairs may be inspected by using an easily obtainable three or four power magnifying glass. periodically checking for any cracking or separation around the area of the welds which join the seat and leg frame sections. The smallest visible crack or separation indicates that damage has begun. If damage is discovered. the chair should be immediately replaced or repaired. CPSC is issuing this warning as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21.600 deaths associated each year with the 15.000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction. The following is Flanders' position: Flanders Industries emphatically denies that any of its chairs failed as a result of any defect in the chair. Flanders made over one million stacking chairs which are identical to chairs still manufactured today by other companies. All of the chairs manufactured by Flanders are now at least eight years old. and many are over 20 years old. The 26 chairs which have been reported to have collapsed have been viewed by Flanders and the company believes that all of those that collapsed had been subjected to severe overuse and abuse. Flanders states that it made a strong. high quality chair which sold for $14.00. but that no product. including these chairs. is indestructible. particularly when subjected to overuse and abuse. Flanders cites the low percentage of reported collapse of their chairs (.0026%) as evidence of the high quality of those chairs manufactured by Flanders during the 15 years it engaged in the manufacture of stacking chairs. Flanders also states that the chairs in question were manufactured in compliance with the only safety standards which existed for the chair at the time of manufacture and emphasizes that those standards are the same that exist for the manufacture of these chairs today. Those standards. published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) were adopted by ANSI from standards promulgated by the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) and such standards were issued in conjunction with and with the approval of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSC does not deny that these standards are the only safety standards in existence applicable to these chairs and that the Flanders' chairs comply with the standards. Flanders believes that the CPSC has adopted a posture that all products should be designed to tolerate unlimited abuse and overuse and that such a standard is unreasonable on its face. Flanders would join with the CPSC in urging all owners of these chairs (or for that matter. any product) to conduct regular inspections in order to assure themselves that the product they are using is not worn out. In the event the inspection reveals problems which cause the owner concern. the owner should take immediate and appropriate steps to remove the product from service and either repair or discard the product, Flanders upholstered metal framed stacking chairs, Chairs.

WHAT TO DO: Call 1-800-350-3425 and ask for the returned goods department or write to Dial Manufacturing. Inc.. 2252 Grand Av.. Phoenix. Arizona 85009 for a free replacement. WASHINGTON. DC -- Dial Manufacturing. Inc. of Phoenix. AZ. CPSC. has voluntarily initiated a replacement program for 150.000 Model D5500 evaporative water cooler pumps sold in 1990 and 1991. Some of the pumps may have misaligned motor bearings that could cause the pumps to fail and. under certain conditions. catch fire. A total of 119 pump fires have been reported to Dial since 1990. Ninety-eight of the fires reported occurred in the El Paso. Texas area. Most of the fires resulted in property damage to the cooler cabinets and/or home roofs. No injuries were reported. Evaporative coolers. commonly known as swamp coolers. are designed to blow moist cool air through ducts into a residence. They are generally found in the drier climates of the western and southwestern United States. The box shaped evaporative cooler cabinets are constructed of plastic or metal and are often installed on top of house roofs. A water cooler pump such as the Dial D5500 model is located inside the cooler cabinet. The pump functions to draw supplied water from the reservoir at the bottom of the cabinet to the distribution system at the top. Water then saturates the cooling pads located vertically inside the vented cabinet. Outside air is cooled and humidified as it is pulled through the pads by the cabinet blower. The blower then forces the moist cool air into the house. Because of the corrosive nature of the cooler environment. economy pumps such as the D5500 reportedly last only one season. However. some of these pumps are still in service. The 1990 Dial D5500 cooler pump has a blue plastic housing and has "1990 Taiwan" inscribed on the base plate. Consumers who identify this blue cooler pump should stop using their evaporative coolers until the pump is replaced. Dial will replace any 1990 blue D5500 cooler pump free of charge with a new 1991 red and white D5500 pump or a 1992 red and white D5000 pump.

DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). the Coleman Company of Wichita. KS today announced the recall of its Model #5360A550 Nightsight PowerStation II Rechargeable Battery Pack because of a potential fire hazard. According to Coleman. the 12-volt DC battery and output plug power cord could short circuit if the protective sleeve covering the positive battery terminal is exposed and contacts the metal ring of the output plug. This could occur. for example. when the battery pack is stored inside its carrying case. Of the more than 9.000 units sold from August. 1991 to mid November. 1991. all but 789 have been located and replaced. In the company's report to CPSC. one short circuit incident occurred October 30. 1991. when a Coleman employee stored the battery pack inside its carrying case. The power cord running from the battery to the output plug overheated and melted. No fire or injury resulted. No incidents have been reported with units sold to consumers. The PowerStation II provides portable 12-volt DC electric power to electric or electronic appliances such as TVs. radios. or spotlights. These appliances must be equipped with a connector that can be plugged into a standard motor vehicle cigarette lighter socket. Consumers can identify affected units by checking the packing carton for the 5360A550 model number and the carton and black carrying case for the label "Coleman Nightsight PowerStation II 12V Rechargeable Battery Pack." In addition. the battery itself is labeled "Panasonic Rechargeable Battery LCR12V6.5PAD" or "Panasonic Rechargeable Battery LCR12V6.5P." Only the carton is labeled with the model number 5360A550. No other PowerStation II models. including models 5360B550 and 5360-550. are involved. Consumers who have purchased a PowerStation II.

WHAT TO DO: Consumers should check their sling seats for "V" bracket hooks that are not completely closed and to close the hooks until the metal touches. WASHINGTON. DC -- The Hedstrom Corporation. in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). voluntarily offered a retrofit kit for Hedstrom sling-type swing seats. to prevent lacerations from hook ends on the swing brackets. The "V"-shaped brackets that attach the sling seats to the swing chains caused serious lacerations when the hook ends of the brackets were not completely closed. The failure to completely close the hooks until the metal touches may result in injury to children. The Hedstrom Corporation had received 18 reports of lacerations to children from open hooks on sling seats. Injuries included leg. arm. face. and groin lacerations. The incidents occurred on seats where bracket hooks were not closed until the metal was touching. Hedstrom sling seats were sold nationally over the past six years as part of Hedstrom or Sears swing sets or separately as swing seat replacements. Approximately two million seats were sold nationally through retailers. wholesalers. and variety stores. The installation instructions for the Hedstrom seats indicate that the hooks should be completely closed. However. because incidents have occurred. swing owners should check their sling seats for "V" bracket hooks that are not completely closed and to close the hooks until the metal touches.The firm is out of business and the additional remedy (free bracket guards to cover the closed hook ends. which were intended to prevent possible injuries from open hooks) is no longer available.

The Maxi Rower consists of two springs. each attached at one end to a common metal frame. and at the other end to separate handles. The user sits on a rolling seat with feet placed in a footrest that is attached to the frame. Overextending the spring on either product may cause it to break and to separate from the footrest bar or from the handle- bar. Upon separation. the spring and handle can strike the user causing eye injury. broken teeth. bruises. and lacerations to the face. head. groin and other parts of the body. Injuries have also occurred from sharp edges on the footrest bar of the Pull-Up Exerciser when the end plugs of the footrest bar come loose. Injuries. including broken bones. have occurred when the frame of the Maxi Rower tipped or broke causing the user to fall. The Commission learned of the problems with the stomach exercisers from a complaint to the Commission's Consumer Hotline. Hanover House Industries reported 26 incidents associated with the Pull-Up Exerciser (1.5 million sold nationwide. 1981-1988). and 12 incidents with the Maxi Rower (701.365 sold nationwide. 1984-1989).

They want to remind consumers that these coffeemakers could represent a significant fire hazard and that consumers in many areas of the U.S. still have not returned their units.The company believes that a fire hazard may occur when a supplier's thermal fuse in the coffeemaker fails to function as intended. About nine million drip coffeemakers bearing the GE or Universal brand name were manufactured between 1976 and 1984. GE has received approximately 500 reports of coffeemakers overheating. It has been alleged that one fire caused by a fuse failure resulted in two fatalities and serious personal injury to eight other people. GE has received claims that fuse failures also may have been responsible for fires that resulted in three additional deaths and 17 personal injuries. Approximately 380 of the claims involve property damage ranging in value from $300 to $1.3 million.As an incentive. GE is offering owners $10 for each recalled unit returned. A $10 check will be mailed when a unit is received by GE. GE will give consumers with recalled coffeemakers pre-paid mailing cartons. The carton will contain instructions that will tell consumers how to arrange for convenient pick-up. This innovative method of recall is aimed at reducing consumer effort and increasing the rate of return. No units made on or after April 28. 1984 are involved in this recall. To determine the date of manufacture. check the date code number stamped on the outside metal blade of the electric plug. If the number is 418 through 600. the coffeemaker is not involved in this recall. Other GE brand and Universal brand drip coffeemakers which are not involved in the recall are: - Space Maker Drip Coffeemakers (catalog numbers that include the designations SDC1. SDC2. and SDC3) - Percolators Owners of a GE brand or Universal brand drip coffeemaker are asked to read both the catalog number on the bottom of the unit and the date code stamped on the outside of the metal blades of the electric plug.

The CPSC has also urged consumers to destroy all food that has been preserved using a Micro-Dome Food Preserver. Consumers who sent in warranty registration cards should have received materials explaining how to return the product for a $50 rebate. However. the rebate program is no longer available and the company may be out of business. Do not use these products. Please discard or destroy these productsThe Micro-Dome Food Preserver is used in microwave ovens to preserve fruits. vegetables and prepared dishes. The appliance is a plastic container that can process one standard metal lidded canning jar at a time. Generally priced at $50. approximately 18.600 units were sold to customers. Micro-Dome informed the Commission that the top of the plastic container may blow off in the microwave if the vent stem or safety release becomes plugged. The pressurized plastic container may also explode during or after removal from the microwave. or if the container is hit or dropped. Furthermore. the plastic container may also crack and/or develop lines (called crazing) that could increase the risk of explosion. Explosion of a pressurized Micro-Dome containing hot water and food could cause severe injuries such as blindness and burns from flying fragments and liquids. Micro-Dome reported 29 incidents involving the cracking and/or crazing of the plastic container. eight incidents of the top blowing off. and four incidents of the vent being plugged without the blow plug releasing. One injury was reported involving a user who sustained minor burns when the top of the container blew off. The CPSC recommends that consumers not use the Micro-Dome Food Preserver. It should be returned to Micro- Dome for the rebate or destroyed and disposed of in such a manner that it cannot be used in the future. CPSC is also concerned about possible food poisoning in certain foods prepared using the Micro-Dome Microwave Food Preserver. While CPSC is unaware of any incidents of food poisoning. it is concerned that the product and its accompanying recipe and instruction booklet do not adequately ensure the safety of certain canned foods. In addition to possibly failing to kill bacteria while the food in the Micro-Dome is cooked in a microwave oven. food also can be contaminated after cooking. Eating improperly preserved food can cause serious illness such as botulism. The toxin which causes botulism is the most potent natural poison in the world. Even one taste could be fatal. The Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has warned that the Micro-Dome needs more extensive testing. There are some problems.

DC -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has determined that the "WORM GETT'RS." an electric worm probe made by PandM Enterprises of Caldwell. Idaho. presents an electrocution hazard and may no longer be produced or sold. In a lengthy decision and Order issued on July 17. 1991. the Commission unanimously upheld the decision of Administrative Law Judge Paul J. Clerman that the PandM "WORM GETT'RS" was defective. The product. which is used to shock worms out of the ground. can expose users and passers-by to a lethal dose of electricity. The worm probe draws full line voltage. 110-120 volts. to its two. six. or 12 bare metal shafts. The Commission found that by touching the exposed shafts. or even by contacting the ground in the vicinity of the probe. consumers could be shocked or electrocuted. Twenty-eight persons. most of them children. have died using "functionally equivalent" worm probes. The Commission ordered PandM to refrain from manufacturing the product. offering it for sale. distributing it. or importing it into the United States. The agency directed its staff to work with PandM to notify the public of the hazard and to warn consumers against further use of the worm probe. Because the owners of PandM have declared bankruptcy. and lack the resources to conduct a recall campaign. the Commission did not require the firm to recall the hazardous probes. PandM can elect to appeal the Commission's decision to a Federal court. The CPSC has taken this action as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The CPSC is a Federal agency responsible for consumer product safety.

DC--In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). the Toro Company. Minneapolis. MN is modifying an estimated 7.500 Vision II Series Irrigation Controllers housed in metal cabinets to ensure proper electrical grounding. The three models being modified include 189-66-01. 189-96-01. and 189-06-01. According to Toro. the metal cabinets of these controllers may not have been electrically grounded when installed. Under certain conditions. the non-insulated metal parts of the cabinet. including the key lock. could become electrically energized and present a severe electric shock or an electrocution hazard. No electric shock incidents have been reported. However. the company warns that incidents could still occur if metal cabinets are not properly grounded. The Vision II Series Irrigation Controller was sold and installed nationwide for home and light commercial use. from September 1989 through December 1990. These irrigation controllers are designed to program a multiple station sprinkler system. The controller is usually installed on the inside wall of a garage. or on a pedestal outside. The Toro Company began its modification program in January 1991. As a result. more than 30 percent of the estimated 7.500 installed irrigation controllers have already been corrected. The Toro Vision II Series metal controller cabinets being reworked can be identified by the painted white cabinet with a red "Toro" logo and a key lock on the door. A "Vision II Series" paper label can be found inside the door. Owners should note that all "Vision Series" irrigation controllers having gray or tan plastic cabinets are not part of this modification program. Toro requests all owners of Vision II Series Irrigation Controllers with metal cabinets who have not been contacted by Toro or their contractor about this modification program to immediately call Toro at 1-800-367-8676. In California call 1-800-255-8676. Correspondence should be sent to: Vision II Series Controller Kit. The Toro Company. Irrigation Division. P.O. Box 489. Riverside. CA 92502. Also. all unidentified contractors who know the location of installed. unmodified (not grounded) Vision II Series Irrigation Controllers should contact Toro. Once contacted. Toro will arrange for the free installation of a modification kit to electrically ground the metal cabinet of each controller. as needed. Toro warns owners of unmodified or ungrounded irrigation controllers not to touch the key lock or the cabinet until the modification has been completed. Owners who have already had their controller corrected need not contact Toro.

MA today announced the further recall of 829 Luxxtra 1800 and 2400 Series 250 Watt Metal Halide Lighting Fixtures. sold and installed from 1980 to November 1990. The company reports that the extreme temperatures generated by the metal halide lamps could cause severe distortion or deformation of the light fixture's socket to stem attachment hardware. As a result. the lamp housing can separate and fall from the stem attachment. Any person struck by the falling lamp housing could sustain severe head or bodily injuries. Fifteen light fixtures have reportedly fallen from the ceilings of buildings from August 1988 to March 1990. These incidents occurred in New Jersey. Michigan. and Arkansas. These metal halide light fixtures were installed nationwide primarily in commercial office buildings. public and university libraries. and in athletic facilities such as school gymnasiums and indoor swimming pools. The incidents occurred after fixtures were in use from one to five years. Though no injuries have been reported. the company believes that some of 829 unlocated light fixtures may be defective and could eventually fall. A total of 5.514 halide light fixtures were initially recalled in August 1990. As a result. 4.685 fixtures have either been located and corrected or found to be no longer in use. Despite the company's repeated efforts to find and correct all installed light fixtures. 829 light fixtures remain unaccounted for. Lam Lighting Systems. Inc. requests any unidentified contractor or distributor who may know the location of light fixtures which have not already been corrected. to contact the company.

Promo-Stepper WASHINGTON. DC -- Dynamic Classics. Ltd. of Saddlebrook. NJ. in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). announced a free retrofit program for its spring exerciser called either the "Exer-Climber" or the "Promo- Stepper." The springs of some 35.000 exercisers sold nationwide from April 1989 through December 1990 may break during use and result in serious foot injuries. The firm has notified CPSC of 82 such injuries. The injuries occurred when the spring broke and part of the spring struck the user's foot. resulting in bruises. lacerations and fractures. The exercisers are a stair-climber type device consisting of two springs. each attached to a black foot pedal and mounted to a metal A-frame. Black or white metal tubular sections and a foam-padded handle are additional parts provided for consumers to assemble the A-frame exercisers. The unassembled products were sold in stores nationwide. The retail price was approximately $45.00. Dynamic Classics is alerting consumers to correct their exercisers with a free retrofit kit being offered by the firm. The kit provides springs with metal brackets on each end to prevent over-stressing and breaking of the end loops of the springs. Exer-Climbers and Promo-Steppers with the metal brackets attached to both ends of the springs do not require the corrective kit. Consumers should immediately discontinue using Exer- Climbers and Promo-Steppers without metal brackets attached to the ends of the springs. The products should not be used until the springs are replaced with the retrofit kit. Consumers should call Dynamic Classics. Ltd. toll-free at 1-800-284-8492 to receive a free retrofit kit. Consumers may also write to: Dynamic Classics. Ltd.. 95 Mayhill Street. Saddlebrook. NJ 07662. Consumers who have an exerciser without metal brackets attached to the ends of the springs. and who do not wish to use or repair it should destroy the exerciser so that no one else may use it and risk injury. The exercisers manufactured after June 1990 have been corrected to prevent breakage. The CPSC was established in 1972 as the Federal agency responsible for product safety.

It has been alleged recently that one fire caused by a fuse failure resulted in two fatalities and serious personal injury to eight other people. GE has received claims that fuse failures also may have been responsible for fires that resulted in one additional death and 15 personal injuries. Approximately 375 of the claims involve property damage ranging in value from $300 to $1.3 million. As an incentive. GE is offering owners $10 for each recalled unit returned. A $10 check will be mailed when a unit is received by GE. GE will give consumers with recalled coffeemakers pre-paid mailing cartons.

Approximately 60 incidents have been reported to CPSC and the firm. most of which involved a broken spring or a footbar assemble coming apart. Consumers have experienced bruises. cuts and lacerations to the face and other parts of the body when the handlebar or spring stuck the user. Incidents showed that the spring of the Rowing Action Exerciser. if extended too far to withstand the stress. could snap.

The retrofit kit includes a safety cord to prevent over-stretching and over-stressing the spring. metal brackets to prevent over-stressing the spring loop. and a new extended footbar to prevent separation. Rowing Action Exercisers sold after August 1987 do not need retrofitting. They can be identified by metal brackets already attached to the top and bottom of the spring and a safety cord installed inside the spring. Earlier models had no brackets and a longer safety cord. Consumers should immediately discontinue the use of older models of the Rowing Action Exerciser. which do not have metal brackets attached to both ends of the spring.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 13. 1988 Release # 88-039 Recall Warning For Black and Decker Weed Trimmers Washington. D.C. -- More than half a million -Black and Decker weed trimmers that present a potential electrocution hazard are still in consumers' hands. despite an earlier recall in November. 1987. the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today. A lower than expected return rate has caused the Commission to take the unusual step of re-issuing the warning. The recall includes approximately 500.000 Black and Decker Model 82209 (Type 1 and 2) and Model 82210 (Type 1 and 2) Bump- Feed Grass/Weed String Trimmers. Due to improper assembly. the wiring in some of these units may be cut by the end of the handle tube. resulting in an electric shock hazard. This hazard can occur while the units are being operated or when they are simply plugged in but not in use. Four consumers were reportedly shocked in separate incidents in 1986 and 1987. when they grabbed the metal handle tube of their string trimmers. Though none of these incidents was fatal. the Commission staff believes that a defective trimmer would present a severe electric shock or an electrocution hazard. These Black and Decker brand string trimmers have been sold since October. 1985. by a variety of retailers for about $24.00 to $29.00. The affected trimmers can be identified by a label decal located near the top of the handle. which states "No. 82209 Grass/Weed Trimmer. Type 1 or Type 2" or "No. 82210 Grass/Weed Trimmer. Type 1 or Type 2" and "Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc.. Easton. MD 21601 U.S.A." Also. the motor housings of the 82209 and 82210 units are labeled 9" cut and 10" cut. respectively.

Inc.. of Shreveport. Louisiana. and Preway Industries of Evansville. Indiana. today announced they would implement a corrective action program for 60.000 high efficiency gas furnaces manufactured by Arkla and Preway and sold nationwide. The Corrective action program was developed by the two manufacturers in response to 387 complaints from owners that their furnaces have experienced internal corrosion. Such corrosion could allow dangerous carbon monoxide to pass into the living areas of the home. Among the complaints of internal corrosion. are eight complaints of nausea. Carbon monoxide is an odorless. but toxic gas which. in large amounts. can cause illness or death. Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are flu-like symptoms -- headache. nausea. stomach upset and drowsiness. Over a period of time. the corrosion may cause the metal in some of the furnace components to deteriorate. and can progress to the point where holes can be created through which carbon monoxide could be released into the home. Subsequent testing has shown affected furnaces to be susceptible to corrosion when exposed to chlorine- or fluorine- containing compounds -- including salt for melting ice. paint stripper. fabric or water softener. bleach and adhesives -- found in some homes. Homeowners should not store or use such products near these furnaces. As part of the corrective action program. Preway and Arkla will inspect the furnaces at no charge. Based on the inspections. they will retrofit furnaces with an upgrade kit at no charge. or if the corrosion is very severe. will replace furnaces on a pro rata basis. Furnaces covered under this plan were manufactured by Arkla and Preway and were sold by the companies listed at the bottom of the page. Arkla and Preway are also continuing an earlier corrective program which includes the replacement of the external vents of furnaces covered by the plan due to corrosion. There have been 2.036 complaints of corrosion and seven allegations of carbon monoxide-related symptoms attributed to corrosion of the external vents of these furnaces. Consumers seeking additional information or clarification are encouraged to call Preway toll-free at 800-237-5207.

DC -- In cooperations with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. General Housewares Corp.. Stamford. Connecticut. today announced a voluntary recall of one. two and three-quart Magnalite Professional saucepans that have covers that fit too tightly. If too much pressure accumulates due to a tight fit. the cover may explode from the saucepan or the cover may become difficult to remove. General Housewares Corp.. has been advised of nine such incidents. six of which reportedly involved burn injuries and two of which reportedly involved property damage. The saucepans that are being voluntarily recalled are any that were produced between September 1984 and July 1985 that have covers that fit too tightly on the saucepan. The saucepans and covers are cast from aluminum ingot. The saucepans are dark grey in color and the word MAGNALITE is impressed on the bottom of the saucepan. The cover and handle have an aluminum metallic shine. which contrasts with the saucepan. The sauce pans sold for a price between $54.00 - $80.00 and were sold in better department stores and gourmet cookware shops. Consumers can test for any overly tight fit by placing the pan on a stable surface. putting the cover on the pan and pushing down firmly. If the saucepan can be lifted by the cover to any degree. the cover is b too tight. The tight fit may not be evident on the first attempt of testing. If not. repeat the test several times but rotate the cover each time to a different point of contact on the saucepan. Another test is to place the cover firmly on the saucepan and gradually turn it 360 degrees in one direction. If the cover rubs closely against the saucepan and locks in place at some point while turning. the cover on the saucepan is too tight. Since July 1985 General Housewares has employed new quality control measures to safeguard against the possibility of a particular cover being too tight for a particular saucepan. General Housewares is accepting returns of saucepans and tight- fitting covers under the l00-year warranty offered on this product.

In 1977. the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a ban to address the risk of tip-over of large unstable metal refuse bins that crushed children climbing or hanging on the bins. The federal ban outlaws metal bins with a volume of more than one cubic yard if they tip over during testing. The Commission test. designed to simulate the climbing and hanging activities of children. requires that bins sustain a horizontal force of 70 pounds and a vertical force of 191 pounds. Before the ban was issued. the Consumer Product Safety Commission had investigated 19 incidents of refuse bin tip-over. involving 21 victims. 20 of them children younger than ten years old. At the time. thirteen children had died from being crushed by unstable refuse bins. Since the 1977 ban. the Commission has investigated an additional 41 incidents of refuse bin tip-over. involving 41 victims. 39 of them children younger than age ten. There have been 16 more deaths. As part of the Commission's continuing surveillance to find all banned unstable refuse bins. investigators from Commission offices in Atlanta. Georgia and Orlando. Florida discovered bins owned by ABC Disposal. Inc. in Port Richey. Florida that failed the federal safety standard. The Commission and ABC Disposal entered into a written agreement giving the firm fourteen days to repair or remove from public areas seven remaining unstable bins.

The Commission and the company are aware of 6 deaths from electric shock related to use of pressure washers manufactured by Britt Tech. Under this program. Britt Tech and its private labelers will provide free material designed to isolate electrically the pressure washer's handle in order to prevent serious electric shock to consumers. Pressure washers are used to clean houses and other buildings and prepare them for painting and to clean shutters. patios. driveways and vehicles. They are frequently used on farms to clean buildings and machinery. Britt Tech and some private labelers will also voluntarily extend the scope of this program to cover commercial series units produced prior to February. 1984. While the firm believes its pressure washers do not present a hazard if operated in accordance with the operator's instructions and warnings on the machines and are not modified in any way. a severe or fatal electric shock can occur when a user contacts the handle of the pressure washer if the machine is ungrounded and a second fault occurs. This could happen if the power cord to extension cord connections become wet. or an improper or faulty extension cord is used. or a fault exists within the pressure washer electrical system. Britt Tech distributed these pressure washers nationally under the "Liquid Brush" trade name and a number of private label trade names (see list below). To obtain the free safety component kit and complete instructions. Iowa residents and others may write to Britt Tech Corporation. Department R. P.O. Box 216. Britt Iowa 50423.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 12. 1983 Release # 84-039 Replacenent Program Announced For Murray Ohio Bicycle Handlebars Stem Assemblies Washington. D.C. -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission the Murray Ohio Manufacturing Company of Brentwood. Tennessee. today announces a voluntary replacement program involving bicycle handlebar stem assemblies on approximately 62.300 BMX bicycles manufactured from August. 1982 through May 1983. The situation involves a random stem weld problem which may permit the stems on the affected units to separate from the handlebars allowing the handlebars to fall off the bicycle. Murray Ohio and the Commission have been informed of approximately 48 incidents where handlebars have reportedly become loose or separated from the bicycle. There have been 17 reports of injuries to the rider due to falls possibly associated with the problem stems. This announcement is being issued in conjunction with Murray Ohio's replacement program undertaken during the past twelve months involving several major retail outlets which reported problems of handlebar separation to Murray Ohio. To date over 12.000 stems have been replaced. The purpose of this announcement is to information consumers who may not already have had their bicycles repaired as to how they may obtain service or replacement parts. Murray Ohio's policy is to replace. free of charge all affected block stems. The following BMX bicycle models are involved in the replacement program: 3-5330x21 3-5330x25 3-5330x38 3-5330x47 3-5330x52 3-5330x63 3-5332x25 3-5622X21 3-5337x52 3-5532x6 3-5430x27 3-5430x30 3-5432x47 3-5432x6 3-5432 3-5532 3-5430 3-5537 3-5337 Murray Ohio's engineering analysis indicates that the problem handlebar stems may cause some looseness in the handlebars. usually early in the bicycle's use. prior to separating from the bicycle. However. there have been a few reports where the stem has separated causing the handlebars to fall off without warning. Murray Ohio redesigned the handlebar stem assemble beginning in May. 1983. to eliminate the problem. The Company has also notified its service centers to replace or repair pillow block stems on all BMX bicycles involved which have been brought in for any service or repair. Consumers who have purchased these bicycles may identify their unit by the model number stamped into the metal on the left or right side of the front of the frame. Dates of production can be verified from the identification decal above the pedal crank. Dates on the decal would be 08-82 through 12-82 and 01 through 05-83. Customers having one of these bicycles. who have not already had them repaired. should contact the nearest Murray Ohio Service Center as listed in the Yellow Pages or in the literature received with the unit. A replacement stem will be installed free of charge by the Service Center. For customers having questions. Murray Ohio can be reached on the following Toll Free number: 1-800-251-9991.

D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers of a carbon monoxide hazard with certain oil/wood combination furnaces. These units were manufactured by Itasca Manufacturing. Inc. of Menahga. MN. The firm is in the process of filing for bankruptcy and is unable to undertake any corrective action for the products. The units involved were sold under the names Itasco Duo Model W0330 and Home Duo Model W0320. CPSC believes the units have demonstrated a pattern of weld failure that could allow carbon monoxide to escape and be drawn into the home. Carbon monoxide can cause Headaches. nausea. and lead to death. Over 100 complaints associated with cracks in the welds of the furnace were reported to the firm. At least one complaint involved various levels of carbon monoxide being emitted into the home. No injuries are known to have occurred. Approximately 12.000 units have been produced and sold since 1972. The model number w0330 and w0320 can be found on a metal plate attached to the unit. CPSC urges owners of these furnaces to contact a qualified professional heating equipment installer and arrange for the furnace to be inspected for cracks. particularly at the top of the heat exchanger between the creosote collectors and around the firebox doors. If cracks are found. consumers should have a certified welder repair them. Any welding repairs should be reinspected yearly. Consumers wishing to pursue a claim may contact the offices of Arntson.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 24. 1984 Release # 84-027 Honeywell-V5130 Gas Valve Announcing Issuance Of Complaint Washington. D.C.-- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announces that its staff has issued an administrative complaint against Honeywell. Inc.. of Minneapolis. Minn.. which alleges that Honeywell's V5130 gas combination control valves contain a defect which. when used with LP gas water heaters. presents a substantial risk of injury to the public from fires and explosions. The Commission has learned of approximately 64 explosion incidents involving this control valve-- including 16 deaths and approximately 35 incidents of personal injury to consumers. The complaint is limited to valves used in water heaters fueled by LP gas. Since LP gas is heavier than air. it does not vent easily and. in the case of a leak. tends to settle toward the floor. accumulate there. and may lead to an explosion when touched off by a nearby ignition source. The combination valve serves the dual purpose of regulating the gas supplied to the water heater and the safety function of shutting off the gas supply when the pilot light becomes extinguished. The complaint alleges that the design of the valve knob. which utilizes plastic lugs keyed into the metal slots of the gas cock. is defective. It maintains that V5130 controls which were made between 1958 and 1976. have knobs that can be easily worn and broken such that the knob can become reversed (rotated 180°) with respect to the gas cock. Should this happen. the knob could become stuck in the depressed position and defeat the pilot-flame safety system. Thereafter. if the pilot flame should go out. the water cools. the thermostat calls for heat. and the control valve opens to heat the water. As a result. substantial quantities of unburned gas will be released through the pilot and main burners and create a serious explosion and/or fire hazard. This control was used on various water heaters manufactured by numerous different manufacturers. Some of the controls are identifiable by the Honeywell name on the front faceplate. Others may only have the name of the water heater manufacturer. The consumer may need to consult his LP gas supplier or a qualified plumber to get positive identification of the valve. Persons who become aware of explosion or fire incidents that may be associated with this product should contact the CPSC on its toll-free Hotline 800-638-CPSC. Information regarding this matter may also be obtained by calling the CPSC toll-free Hotline.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 12. 1984 Release # 84-022 Shakespeare Company Recalls Omnidirectional CB Antenna Washington. D.C. --In cooperation with the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. the Shakespeare Company. Newberry. South Carolina. is voluntarily recalling two models of their omnidirectional CB base station antennas. Style 176-S and 176-SU. If contact is made by the antennas with an electrical power line while being installed or taken down. the antennas have the potential for severe or fatal shock. The CPSC stated that in tests conducted on the two models. they failed to comply with the new mandatory standard enforced by CPSC. The standard is intended to reduce the electrocution hazard if the antenna should accidentally contact a power line while being removed or installed. The CPSC is not aware of any injuries or deaths involving any of the Shakespeare antennas. The agency estimated. however. that approximately 45-50 individuals were electrocuted each year through 1981 as a result of CB antennas coming into contact with electrical power lines while the antennas are being put up or taken down. Therefore. consumers should not take down any of the recalled Shakespeare antennas which are already installed. The Shakespeare Company distributed 10.637 of the affected antennas nationwide from May through November of 1983. Each of these recalled antennas bears a three letter code located on the bottom of its metal sleeve and on the identification label on the end of the packaging tube as follows: CHF. CHE. CHD. CHC. CHB. CHA. CHL. CHM. The affected antennas have already been removed from dealers and replaced. Retailers who still have those models in stock should return them to the Shakespeare Company immediately for replacement. Consumers owning any of the models affected which have not been installed should contact Shakespeare. toll-free (800-845-7750) to verify if the antenna is subject to the recall. If so. the consumer should return the antenna to the dealer for a full refund. Consumers who have already installed the affected models should leave them alone. These persons can obtain an additional warning label (or hang tag) to be placed in a conspicuous location on the product to warn future users about the potential hazard. The label (or hand tag) can be obtained by calling the Shakespeare Company at its toll free number (800-845-7750) or writing the firm at RFD #3. P.O. Box 733. Newberry. South Carolina 29108. As a normal practice. individuals planning to install or take down a CB antenna should first contact their local power company for advice.

D.C.-- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Pixieland. Incorporated. Swainsboro I Georgia. today announced a voluntary repair program on five different models of its metal playground equipment which may present head entrapment hazards to children. The products involved are the Double Climber Slide. Single Climber Slide. Toddler Climber. Fence Climber and Rainbow Climber. The five models of metal playground equipment. which range in cost from approximately $85 to $450. are intended for use by pre-school children. and are sold to day care centers. child care centers and other similar facilities. The spacing between some of the rungs on these five models pose a potential entrapment hazard because they are wide enough to allow a child's body to pass all the way through. but are too narrow for the head to follow. Consequently. a child could be hung. with his head trapped between the rungs and his feet off the ground. This could result in head injuries. neck injuries. or strangulation. All spacings ranging from 4.5 inches to 7.5 inches represent potential entrapment hazards. The Commission has investigated three incidents in which children's heads became entrapped between the rungs on these playground structures. One victim received contusions and abrasions to the neck and head. while another victim had to be resuscitated because his breathing and pulse had been stopped. Pixieland has been manufacturing these playground structures since 1978. with distribution to 21 states east of the Rockies. In 1978. the firm began to redesign this equipment to eliminate the potential head entrapment hazard. However. some of these units still have spacing between the rungs which are in the potential entrapment range of 4.5 to 7.5 inches. The Double Climber Slide. Single Climber Slide. and Rainbow Climber all are rainbow-shaped with apex approximately 4' from the ground. Each is approximately 4'4" wide and 15' to 16' in length. The Single Climber and Double Climber Slides have one and two sliding boards respectively. while the Rainbow Climber has no slide. The Toddler Climber is 3' high 3' wide. and 4' long. while the Fence Climber is similar in design but measures 4' high. 4' wide. and 6' long. A sticker label with the Pixieland name and address may be found on some of these structures. All day care centers. child care centers. etc.. are urged to determine whether they have any of the five models of playground equipment. If they do. the spacings between all rungs should be measured. If any spacing measures from 4.5 inches to 7.5 inches. discontinue use of the equipment immediately. Firm is out of Business.

The 99/4A model home computers have been sold in a variety of retail outlets over the past year at suggested retail prices of $450 and $375 with $100 rebate in effect since September 11. 1982. All owners of the 99/4A known to the company through rebate cards or warranty cards will receive the adapters automatically by mail. The company asks owners who are not sure their names and addresses are in its files to call the Texas Instruments toll free numbers (800-858-4565 or 800-527-3550 ) (Texas only: 800-858-1802). and request that the adapter be sent to them. Prior to receipt and installation of the adapter plug or cord. the company advises consumers to unplug and discontinue using computer if any sign of transformer overheating. unusual odor. or computer malfunction occurs. Texas Instruments is also instituting a green "Safety Check" label for easy recognition by customers that the transformers in inventory at retail stores have been inspected and modified as necessary.

(January 26) -- Following reports of serious injuries involving snowmobile drive tracks. a three to four million dollar voluntary repair program to correct approximately 16.500 1978 and 1979 model snowmobiles was announced today by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Kawasaki Motors Corp. (USA) of Santa Ana. California. CPSC staff learned of the problem with the snowmobile tracks in May. 1980. when the company notified CPSC of several incidents involving bar detachment injuries. To date. CPSC staff has been informed by Kawasaki of approximately 20 such injury incidents. including fractures or severe lacerations which in three cases required the amputation of a finger. These incidents occurred when the snowmobile had been lifted or turned on its side and the track was rotating at high speeds. In settlement of its alleged failure to report promptly to CPSC information which the Commission believes indicated that these snowmobile tracks could pose a substantial risk of injury to the public. Kawasaki has agreed to pay $90.000 to CPSC. The snowmobile tracks involved are the MGB (molded grouser bar) type which were designed and manufactured by Kawasaki and by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.

Sears is conducting the program voluntarily in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The saws can accommodate several types of blades. including a carbide-tipped blade often used to cut soft metals. Because a carbide-tipped blade is thicker than the original blade provided with the saw. consumers may improperly fasten the carbide blade to the motor shaft. creating the possibility that the saw blade may spin off the saw while in use. CPSC has been informed of three instances in 1980 in which carbide-tipped blades being used on the saws disengaged while still spinning. One incident resulted in severe facial lacerations to the consumer. No injuries were reported in the other two cases. The repair program applies to the model 315.23730 and the 315.23731 "Craftsman Motorized Miter Saws." The model numbers can be found on a plate on the saw motor.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 4. 1979 Release # 79-046 Major Corrective Action Set On Corning Ware Coffee Percolators WASHINGTON. D.C. (Sept. 4) -- Corning Glass Works and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced a voluntary action by the company to remove virtually all Corning Ware coffee percolators from consumer use. Some of these coffeemakers can be dangerous to use because the handle and metal band may separate without warning from the white glass-ceramic pot. Consumers owning Corning Ware percolators are advised to stop using them immediately. If such a separation occurs on a coffeemaker containing hot liquid. the consumer can be burned. As part of its voluntary corrective action. Corning has prepared an incentive program to get consumers to stop using these coffeemakers. The company has purchased advertising space in hundreds of newspapers nationwide telling consumers what to do. The advertisements. scheduled to appear beginning September 10th. will contain coupons through which coffeemaker owners may obtain details from Corning regarding the plan. Consumers also may receive information concerning the program from Corning Glass Works. P.O. BOX 5750. Corning. New York 14830. but are requested to use the coupons which will be appearing in their local newspapers. The Commission has accepted Corning's Corrective action Plan. Corning has manufactured and sold approximately 18.5 million Corning Ware percolators since they were introduced in 1960. Due to normal product attrition. a smaller number is believed to be still in use. In 1976 Corning recalled approximately 400.000 electromatic percolators manufactured in 1974. With respect to its other percolators. since 1972 Corning has received approximately 7.000 separation complaints including reports of approximately 1.250 injuries. Corning said these represent approximately 4 complaints and 0.7 injury complaints per 10.000 percolators sold. Corning said that these rates are low. but it has decided voluntarily to remove the percolators from service rather than risk any further injuries or inconvenience on the part of its customers. The cause of the separation problem has been traced to the epoxy sealant which was intended to fasten the handle/metal band assembly to the white glass-ceramic pot. This sealant can dry out and become brittle. causing the two parts to separate without warning. The separation problem does not extend to Corning's "Pyrex" brand clear glass percolators or to any other Corning coffeemakers. and those products are not included in the program. Corning said. The Commission and Corning request that consumers not return coffeemakers to the company or to retailers. They should be taken out of use immediately and retained until the owner receives instructions on the program from Corning. Corning said consumers should allow at least eight weeks for the company's response., Corning Ware Pyrex coffee percolators, Coffeemakers/Coffeepots/Teapots/Kettles, Corning / Corningware, n/a, n/a, Coffee Percolators/Coffeemakers Corrected by Corning, False

Inc.. an importer and distributor with headquarters in New York City. is voluntarily recalling approximately 3.600 toy cork rifles because they may injure children's eyes. The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. According to CPSC staff. children run the risk of serious eye injuries if they remove the gun's muzzle and fire toward their faces. an action which could drive two interior metal rods into their eyes. These "pushrods." which serve to expel the cork from the toy I normally are protected from extending to their full 8-inch length by small plastic barriers. However. some barriers may be positioned improperly. allowing the metal rods to project completely when the trigger is pulled. While F. J. Strauss never has received a complaint about the toy. CPSC received a report earlier this year that a 3+year-old boy suffered eye injuries from an identically constructed toy cork gun made by another manufacturer; all of these models have since been recalled. Strauss has told CPSC that other firms also have distributed identical toy guns. The cork guns have been marketed since 1977 in cardboard boxes which are labeled "F. J. Strauss Co.. Inc.. New York. New York. 10010." The cartons also are labeled with the trademark "Straco." and with "Western Double-Barrel Cork Rifle." They sold for approximately $1.99 at various retail outlets.

N.Y.. in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today reissued the announcement of its October 20. 1978 recall of two models of room air conditioners produced between 1962 and 1964. The company said engineering tests on several of the 14 - 16 year old units have revealed deterioration of a terminal board insulator. which could cause an electrical short that might ignite adjacent combustible material. Three fires in May 1978. in an apartment complex in Anaheim. Calif.. were reported by the company to CPSC. There were no reported injuries. The product is a 6.000 BTU air conditioner sold under the Carrier "Weathermaker" brand name and bearing model number 51GA0661 or 51GB0661. The model number is on a metal plate behind the unit's decorative front grille. which can be snapped out easily. The units are used to cool a single small room. such as a bedroom. and are usually installed in a window. The units are about 16-l/2 inches high. 22 inches wide. and 11-l/4 inches deep. and weigh 100 pounds. They were sold throughout the continental United States from 1962-65 at a retail price of $185-$210. Carrier said that it produced 21.591 of the units. but because they are now well beyond their normally expected product life it is estimated that only as many as 2.782 units or as few as 628 might still be in service. Consumers having one of these units are urged not to use it and to disconnect it from the electrical outlet. They should telephone their nearest Carrier room-air conditioning dealer. listed in the Yellow Pages. to arrange for a free repair.

(Feb. 5) -- Eagle Family Discount Stores. Inc.. Opa Locka. Fla.. in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). today warned consumers that about 5.844 double-barreled toy cork shotguns sold in their stores during the 1976 and 1977 Christmas seasons may present a hazard of eye injury to a young child. Consumers who have bought one of these toys should not let their children play with it. and should return it to their nearest Eagle Family Discount Store for a full refund. CPSC believes that serious eye injury could occur if a child abuses the toy by removing the muzzle end of the gun barrel. exposing the ends of two metal rods covered with plastic plunger caps. These caps can be removed by a force of three or four pounds. leaving the ends of the metal rods completely exposed. If the toy gun is cocked and discharged. the exposed ends of the metal rods could then be propelled forward into a child's face or eyes. The double-barreled toy cork shotgun retailed for about $1.27 in Eagle Family Discount Stores located in Florida and in a few stores in Alabama and Georgia. according to Eagle. The words. "Gun Fighter." appear in silver on each side of the toy gun. The stock is colored brown. the gun barrels are black and the cocking lever is chrome-colored plastic. The toy gun was made in Hong Kong or Taiwan. according to Eagle. and was identified as product no. 97-S-510.. which appears on the toy gun's package. To date. CPSC is aware of one incident of eye injury occurring when a three and one-half year-old boy apparently shot the toy gun into his eyes and was struck by the unprotected metal rod. Although the injury occurred to a three and one-half year old. the product's package contains. according to Eagle. a cautionary statement that the toy shotgun is not recommended for children under five years of age.

The units are about 16 1/2 inches high. 22 inches wide. 11 1/4 inches deep and weigh 100 pounds. They were sold throughout the continental U.S. during the years 1962-65 at a retail price of $185 to $210. Carrier said the company had produced a total of 21.591 such units. that they are now well beyond their normally expected product life. and that age. moisture and heat contributed to the deterioration of the electrical terminal board. The company estimates that as many as 2.782 units or as few as 628. might still be in service. Consumers having units as identified for the recall are urged to disconnect the air conditioner from the electrical outlet and to cease using it immediately. They should telephone their nearest Carrier room air conditioning dealer. as listed in the Yellow Pages Directory. Units will be repaired at no cost to the consumers.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 14. 1978 Release # 78-021 CPSC Warns On Hazardous Baseball Pitching Machines WASHINGTON. DC (April 14) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today warned the public not to use certain unguarded automatic baseball pitching machines which it considers extremely hazardous. The Commission advises anyone having possession of such unguarded machines to place these machines in a locked storage area where unwary persons will not have access to them. The machines. which were sold to schools. recreational organizations and individuals. may be labeled "Dudley" or "Commercial Mechanisms." In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court. the Commission alleges that the unguarded. rotating metal pitching arm can go off suddenly. without warning. and strike persons standing in the path of the arm. The Commission alleges that this has happened in numerous incidents even though the machines were unplugged or turned off. Everyone should be careful of pitched balls. However. the hazard addressed in this action relates to the unguarded arm. The Commission has received numerous reports of serious injuries -- including paralysis. skull fractures. brain damage. loss of sight. and other severe injuries such as broken bones -- suffered by persons hit by the pitching arm. In one reported incident. a nine-year-old boy was left a permanent paraplegic as a result of being hit in the head by the pitching machine. According to reports received by the Commission: baseball coaches. high school students. "Little League" instructors. and even small children who have come up to the machine just to look at it. have been seriously injured. These reported injuries have occurred on school grounds. in city parks. and at private homes. Reportedly. about 7.500 of the baseball pitching machines were manufactured between 1956 and 1975 and distributed nationwide. The majority of the owners appear to be institutions such as schools and "Little League" teams. but some machines are privately-owned. The machines were sold under various brand names including: "Olympia. " "Olympic." "Champ." "Blazer." "Super Blazer." "Pro-Blazer." "Range Blazer. " "Range. " "Master." "Mentor." "Pro-Trainer." and "Professional." The pitching machines are operated by electricity or gasoline engine. Even when the machine is turned off or unplugged. however. if the pitching arm is cocked in approximately the "10 o'clock position." the machine can fire if jarred or subjected to vibration. Consequently. the Commission warns that the machines should be locked up to prevent accidents and should never be left in areas where children can reach them. Before locking up the machine. CPSC advises that the pitching arm cable be disconnected carefully from the coil spring. The Commission has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the manufacturer and distributors of the machines to provide a guard for the pitching arm at no cost to the purchaser. Without such a guard. the Commission warns. the machines are dangerous and may cause severe injury. The Commission urges people not to use these machines., Blazer automatic baseball pitching machines, n/a, Professional, Laceration, n/a, Baseball Pitching Machines Warning, False

These hot pots come in various color combinations and are decorated with several different types of decals. The box in which the unit is packaged is clearly marked with the Nevco name. On the bottom of each unit are imprinted the words "120V-350W JAPAN." They have been sold nationwide under the Nevco name since January 1975. and have retailed from $2.99 to $4.99. Because these same unbranded pots have been imported and distributed by other yet unidentified firms. consumers who do not have the box are asked to contact the dealer from whom they purchased the pot or Nevco to confirm that this is one of the pots on which refund can be given. If so. the consumer should return the hot pot to Nevco. Page & Schuyler Avenues. Lyndhurst.

When this happens. the thermostat will fall away from the heating element and the unit will remain in a constant "On" position. generating unnecessary heat until it ignites the plastic case. Consumers who own a Nobility coffeemaker. Model #151. should stop use immediately and return the unit to the store where purchased for a full refund. All coffeemakers involved in the recall have the name "NOBILITY" written across the front of the upper section of the unit where the water is added.

The units have been sold nationwide under the Nobility name since approximately June 1976. and retailed for about $16.50. These same coffeemakers have been imported and distributed by other as yet unidentified firms under different brand names. All units. however. bear the same inscriptions on the base plate.

Ohio. in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. today warned consumers that 25.000 bicycle child carriers may separate from the bicycle if not carefully installed. The carriers were sold nationally under the trade name "Tote Along" during the summer of 1976. Persons who have these carriers should carefully inspect both the latching mechanism which locks the detachable child seat to the carrier and the metal clamp which attaches the front of the carrier to the bicycle frame. Before placing a child in the carrier. check to see that the seat and clamp are secure. The warning was issued after the companies reported to CPSC 10 accidents which involved either a separation of the seat from the carrier or of the carrier from the bicycle. Separation of the seat from the carrier appears to have been caused by a failure to push the seat onto the carrier far enough to secure the locking mechanism. Separation of the carrier from the bicycle may have been caused by consumer misalignment of the metal clamp components and/or extreme over-tightening of the bolt passing through the clamp. In the interest of child safety. the companies are recalling the "Tote Along" carrier and are offering a refund to consumers who send them the seat clamp.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 12. 1975 Release # 75-072 CPSC And Woods Wire Products. Inc. Warn Of Severe Shock Hazard WASHINGTON. D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Woods Wire Products. Inc. today announced that some 40.000 clamp-on lamps with metal reflectors. manufactured during 1970 and 1971 by Woods Wire Products. Inc. may pose an imminent danger of severe electric shock. When the lamp is plugged in. the metal spring protecting the cord from strain at the base of the bulb socket cap may become electrically "hot." thus creating a shock hazard. Most of the lamps were sold in retail stores between April 1970 and December 1971 for approximately $3.00. Some may still be available. Retailers are being notified. The lamp consists of a bulb socket attached to a bowl-shaped metal reflector and to a clamp capable of gripping the edge of a door. table top. or other item of furniture. Such lamps are used for a variety of purposes requiring extra illumination. Consumers can determine whether theirs is one of the potentially defective lamps by DISCONNECTING THE LAMP from the electrical outlet and examining it as follows: The lamp will have a metal spring at the base of the socket. surrounding the power cord and extending into the base of the bulb socket cap. The wire usually has a black vinyl covering. with the trademark "INDUSTRO R" and "300 Volts" printed in white letters. These two characteristics will identify the lamp. but consumers should be aware that the metal spring is the primary identifier. After DISCONNECTING and identifying the lamp. consumers should separate the socket cap from the assembly and examine the inside of the socket. If there is a cardboard disc between the spring and the socket assembly. the lamp does not present the potential hazard. However. if there is no such insulator disc. the consumer should call the manufacturer Woods Wire Products. Inc. toll free at 800/428-9511 (In Indiana call collect at 317/844-7262) to receive instructions on how to return the potentially defective socket assembly to the manufacturer.

(July 26) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers that some 200.000 household "trouble lights" or "mechanic's lights" sold in the past year pose an imminent danger of serious or fatal electric shock. Consumers should immediately cease use of the product. taking extreme care not to touch any metal parts when disconnecting the light from the electrical outlet. The light was manufactured by A. K. Electric Corporation. Brooklyn. New York. It has been distributed by several firms and sold by stores across the country. including Woolco Department Stores. Zayre. Korvettes. Food Fair. and J. J. Newberry. The trouble light retails for about $1.50. The potentially dangerous "trouble light" bears no brand name. label. or other distinguishing marks. Its appearance is similar to many other mechanics' lights. Consumers who are uncertain whether they own a potentially hazardous light should immediately discontinue use !of the product and check with the store where it was purchased to identify the manufacturer. The product consists of either a 5. 10. or 20-foot flexible cord with a male plug at one end and a light socket assembly at the opposite end. The light bulb is enclosed by a metal case and hinged wire guard with a hook at the top. The socket assembly Contains an on-off switch together with a double female receptacle subassembly.

If the handle is grasped in a normal manner. the user's hand or fingers may. because of the soft. flexible plastic cover. contact the metal of the receptacles. creating a serious potential for electric shock. This warning is being issued because it is the view of the Commission that the "trouble light" in question is imminently hazardous and presents an imminent and unreasonable risk of death or severe personal injury to the public.

D.C.(Feb. 25) --The Consumer Product Safety Commission today urged purchasers of a particular toy chest to return the chests to the retailer where they were purchased for a full refund. The toy chests. manufactured by the Jackson Furniture Corporation. Jackson. Tenn.. were sold by 40 retailers. including Sears. Roebuck and Company. who sold the chest through its catalog. Tile action came after the chests were reportedly associated with the death of one child and serious injury to another in separate incidents. The accidents apparently resulted from the children's heads being caught between the front of the case and the top of the chest. Some 13.000 of the chests were manufactured by Jackson Furniture. and 95 percent were sold through the Sears catalog during the past four years. The Consumer Product Safety Commission believes most of these are still in the hands of consumers. The CPSC notified Jackson Furniture Corporation and Sears last November 7 that the chest was involved in the accidents. The death occurred September 3. 1973. and the serious injury January 1972. Jackson discontinued production. and Sears took the items off sale November 21. Jackson issued a national announcement on November 26 advising its retailers to take the chest off sale. The Sears chests can be identified by their padded 3-inch top and come in three colors--yellow. orange. and walnut finish-- with a side print design of lambs and daisies. The Sears catalog listed the chest under model numbers 88063. 88064. and 88065. Sears will continue to refund the full price of the chest in accordance with company policy. A redesigned chest with a lighter and flat lid is now being sold in the Sears catalog. This redesigned chest is not involved in the above action. The Jackson Furniture Corporation. who sold similar chests to 39 other retailers. stated that it will refund the full wholesale price to retailers for return of the chests. The chests are identical in construction to the Sears chests except for a pale yellow metal frame with sides and top decorations in a series of white. green. and yellow circles and star patterns. The name of Jackson Furniture Corporation is located on a fixed tag inside the chest. The chests are listed by Stock No. 9023 which is stamped on the packing carton but not on the chest itself.

(Feb. 6)--The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers who may have purchased a "Rainbow Lamp". also known as a "Mini Shadowy Stand" lamp. to immediately discontinue use of the product. The Commission said the lamp-- which retails for approximately $1.98-- contains defects which could result in a fatal electric shock. Some 35.000 lamps have been sold since February. 1973. They were advertised nationally in TV Guide. Sunday newspaper supplements. including Parade Magazine; Ladies Home Journal; and in the "New Discoveries from Greenland" catalog which was mailed to several million consumers over the last few months. The Commission said the lamps were distributed in the United States by Greenland Studios. 4500 Northwest. 135th Street. Miami. Florida. They were imported from Taiwan and carry the model number 13348 in some of the advertisements but not on the lamp or package. The Commission warned consumers to use "extreme care" in disconnecting the lamp plug from electrical outlets. and to avoid touching any metal objects while doing so. The lamp is designed to cast shadows of various shapes on walls when in use and has been advertised as providing a "sensuous light show". Consumers Union notified the Commission of the possible hazard. on February 1. 1974. The Commission immediately secured samples of the lamps and began testing. Further importation and sales of the lamps have been halted and the Commission said the company is cooperating fully with the Commission and has voluntarily agreed to refund the full purchase price on all returns. including cost of postage. In addition. the company has agreed to make a direct mailing to known purchasers. warning them of the hazard and offering to repurchase the lamps.

DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 8. 1973 Release # 73-003 Consumer Product Safety Commission Says Some Tappan Built-In Ovens May Pose Hazard To Consumers WASHINGTON. D.C. (June 8) - The Consumer Product Safety Commission Friday said it has learned from the Tappan Company of a defect in certain Tappan Company built-in gas ovens manufactured for installation primarily in mobile homes and other newly constructed homes. The Commission said the defect --a possible loose fitting connection-- could result in a hazard to consumers from gas leakage. The ovens in question were manufactured between January 23. 1973. and May 31. 1973. by the F.H. Lawson Company. Springfield. Tennessee. for the Tappan Company. While the majority of the ovens carry the "Tappan" name. some were produced for Montgomery Ward and carry the brand-name "Signature." According to Tappan. the problem occurred in some 15.185 ovens. of which 11.974 have been shipped from the place of manufacture. The ovens carry model numbers AZ12-1239; AZ12-1249; AZ12-1441; AKTM-3850; and AKTM-3893. Some 8.172 of the ovens-- model number AZ12-1239-- are used exclusively in mobile homes. The Montgomery Ward ovens--"Signature"--carry the "AKTM" model number prefix. CPSC Chairman Richard 0. Simpson said the Commission is asking wholesalers. distributors. and retailers who may have the affected ovens in stock or installed in mobile homes or newly constructed homes immediately to contact the Tappan Company. In addition. Simpson said consumers who may have purchased a Tappan or "Signature" built-in oven with one of the model numbers in question should contact their local gas company or the nearest Tappan dealer regarding possible gas leakage between the shut-off valve and the pressure regulator. The Commission was told by Tappan that consumers can locate the model number on the oven by opening the top oven door and looking at the metal strip at the top of the oven which carries the model number on it. CPSC investigators have been sent to the Tappan headquarters. Mansfield. Ohio. and to the F.H. Lawson Company to determine whether the remedial action proposed by Tappan is appropriate and to determine the degree of potential hazard to consumers., n/a, Ovens/Stoves/Ranges/Microwaves, F.H.
